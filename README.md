# bubble-bot
This is my repository for working on the bubble bot from discord. It's just a bot made for fun, was created only for personal purposes and not for commercial use,
between the bot functionalities you can find:

  - Integration with Spotify (search an artist cover, search an album cover, search for playlists).
  - Surveys (to help the server decision making, etc).
  - Integration with Wikipedia (do a little query for a concept).
  - Integration with Youtube (search for a video).
  
And other features that i'll add as soon as i can.

To use the bot commands you just have to use the '#' character, use #help to see all the commands, for educational purposes,
i'm going to show all the added commands anyways:

## *Commands:*

- #wave: bubble will wave at you :D.

SSAYKO's important note:
> This a bot in development so, not all the functions are 100% functional and free of bugs or errors, and not all the 
functions are finished yet, so, the commands you see in this page, are the commands that are working already. Thank you for watching this repo.
